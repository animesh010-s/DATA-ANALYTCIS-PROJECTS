# Ad-campaign-AB-Testing
Facebook is a widely popular social network platform created by Meta. In fact, it is among the greatest players in the digital market, with over 2.96 billion monthly active users for the year 2023. With such a large user base, Facebook has many potential as an effective marketing/advertising channel and is chosen by many digital marketers. 

The main business question the project aiming to investigate is the effectiveness (measured by CR, CTR and CPC) of three different ad campaigns conducted by an anonymous origanization on Facebook in 2017. To conduct the analysis, I will compare the difference between the three marketing campagin based on analysis of KPIs computed from the data and conduct A/B testing to check if the effect of each marketing campaign is truly due to causality.
